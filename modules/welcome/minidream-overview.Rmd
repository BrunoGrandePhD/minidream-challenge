# The mini-DREAM Challenge

## Why are you here?

- To complement your research projects with the **CSBC/PS-ON Summer Research Program**...

- Our goals for this mini-DREAM Challenge are to:
    - Introduce you to **data science** and **basic model building**
    - Educate you on **cancer** and some specific biology related to breast cancer
    - Guide you through realistic analysis activities to solve common problems

## But what's a "challenge"?

- Crowd-sourced data challenges (e.g., Kaggle): participants submit their own attempts to answer complex questions from a common dataset

```{r, out.width="300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dream-logo.png")
```

- **DREAM Challenges** (<a href="http://dreamchallenges.org/" target="_blank">website</a>): focused on biomedical datasets and questions, with the goal of improving ability to understand and predict disease outcomes

- Open, incentivized competitions through DREAM have led to important insights and benchmarks

## Breast Cancer Prognosis DREAM Challenge

- Goal: assess accuracy of computational models designed to predict **breast cancer survival** based on clinical information as well as genome-wide molecular measurement data

- **METABRIC dataset**: 2,000 breast cancer samples, 1,000 of which were provided to participants to train models

- Solutions improved over duration of the challenge; results and lessons from challenge published in 2013:
    - Margolin, et al. *Science Translational Medicine*
    - Cheng, et al. *Science Translational Medicine*

## CSBC mini-DREAM Challenge

- Same data and questions as original Breast Cancer Prognosis DREAM Challenge

- ***You*** will work with the data and step through the process of building predictive models for cancer survival

- Module lectures will cover basics of concepts related to computational modeling and breast cancer

# Course Roadmap

## Challenge modules

What to expect (also on <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8650663/wiki/436427" target="_blank">**Challenge Modules**</a> page):

- **Module 0**: Welcome, setup, & orientation
- **Module 1**: Introduction to R
- **Module 2**: Introduction to breast cancer & basic modeling
- **Module 3**: Working with genomic data
- **Module 4**: The curse of dimensionality
- **Module 5**: Integrating biological knowledge

If this doesn't make sense to you right now, that's OK!

*Each module builds on the previous &mdash; designed to guide you step-by-step through what you need to do.*

## Challenge activities

- Each module includes a hands-on programming activity in **R**

- As part of activities, you'll submit your own predictions to the Challenge

- Results show up on scoreboards, but this **isn't a competition**! We'll teach you exactly how to build models &mdash; scoreboards are just a fun way to track your progress.

## Beyond mini-DREAM

What to do after this course?

- Learn more about R, data science, and computational biology! (lots of free resources online)
- Participate in a real DREAM Challenge
- Use these approaches in your own research

# R

## What is R?

- Powerful programming language designed for doing statistical analyses

- Great tools for exploring, visualizing, and manipulating data

- Open source: free to use, with huge community that is constantly contributing new packages

## Why use R?

- Widely used by data scientists in technology industries and academic research

- Rich ecosystem of tools for specific data types and applications (e.g., **Bioconductor** packages for computational biology)

- Get a job? R was 3rd highest paid programming language in 2016 (<a href="http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/15-highest-paying-programming-languages-2016-01559832" target="_blank">Business2Community</a>)

## Why not use ____?

- Python also widely used for data science (and plenty of other software applications)

- Other relevant languages for modeling? Matlab, Julia, Java, Perl

- R still more popular in biomedical research community (and it's what *we* use for most analysis), but above languages can be great too!

## How will I use R for the mini-DREAM Challenge?

- No prior programming knowledge required!

- Most mini-DREAM R activities will provide code for you &mdash; just point and click

- Goal is to show you what R does and how it can help you, not teach you how to program in R (which could take an entire summer by itself)

# RStudio

## mini-DREAM activities environment

- Module activities will use a shared RStudio workspace for working with R code

- Environment located on a "cloud" computing machine in Amazon EC2

- No need to install or download anything; all required packages and data pre-loaded

```{r out.width="500px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/environment.png")
```

## What is RStudio? 

- **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): create, view, and explore code, variables, files, plots, etc. all in one application


```{r out.width="400px", out.extra='style="background:none; border:none;"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio.png")
```

- RStudio also provides lots of helpful features that make writing R code easier
