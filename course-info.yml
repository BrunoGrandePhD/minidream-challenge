description: |
   In this course, we will use breast cancer data and questions to introduce 
   basic concepts of data analysis to undergraduate students. We'll explore 
   multiple approaches to characterize cell motility, breast cancer metastasis, 
   and the relationship between these processes. 
   
   Students will learn about breast cancer and its molecular basis and gain 
   basic skills in the manipulation and analysis of different data types. 
   Students will get the chance to work with real datasets from large 
   scientific projects: breast cancer cell line motility and genomic data from 
   the PS-ON Cell Line Characterization study; and breast cancer patient 
   clinical and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
